## Overview

The Loksabha Election Analysis project explores key factors affecting election outcomes across India. By leveraging comprehensive datasets, the analysis covers:

- Historical voting patterns
- Demographic and socio-economic correlations
- Regional electoral shifts and trends
- Visualization of key statistics and comparisons

The objective is to provide insights that can support political analysis, academic research, and informed public discourse.

## Data Sources

The analysis is based on the following key resources:

- **Notion Page:** Detailed documentation and project context are provided on our [Notion page](https://jolly-bucket-eb0.notion.site/Loksabha-Election-Analysis-caeec9c17fbb4afcadc2cc4a271d7cbe).
- **PDF Report:** A merged PDF containing raw data, supplementary analysis, and visualizations is available [here](https://file.notion.so/f/f/44beb92b-b1d7-4ff2-87e3-ebfe5a23f393/bb7775c7-505f-404e-b7b1-0e20cc03242f/ilovepdf_merged.pdf?table=block&id=b263976a-6ee8-40fa-ac08-9d8e54b25342&spaceId=44beb92b-b1d7-4ff2-87e3-ebfe5a23f393&expirationTimestamp=1743969600000&signature=pqFPztA5tq_Wm-oetsWIMV7LRJh8KkxWnOTCHfzs1-k&downloadName=ilovepdf_merged.pdf).

These resources include data on electoral outcomes, candidate profiles, and other relevant socio-political metrics.

## Methodology

The analysis incorporates several key steps:

1. **Data Collection & Cleaning:**  
   Aggregation of election data from various sources followed by data cleansing to ensure consistency and accuracy.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   Statistical summaries and visualizations (e.g., histograms, box plots, scatter plots) to understand distributions and trends.

3. **Modeling & Analysis:**  
   Application of statistical models and machine learning algorithms to uncover patterns in voter behavior and election outcomes.

4. **Visualization:**  
   Interactive dashboards and static graphs to illustrate key findings.

5. **Interpretation:**  
   Detailed discussion of the implications of the results and potential areas for further research.

## Results and Findings

The project has yielded several key insights:

- **Regional Disparities:**  
  Differences in voting patterns across regions have been identified, highlighting areas of strong political leanings and emerging shifts.

- **Demographic Influence:**  
  Analysis indicates that factors such as age, education, and income levels have significant correlations with voting behavior.

- **Predictive Trends:**  
  Preliminary models suggest that historical data can offer reasonable predictions for future election outcomes under certain conditions.
